# Weekly operations review

Create one source-backed review of open work, recent outputs, unresolved decisions, and proposed learning.

<!-- TUEL:SCHEDULE-CONTRACT:START -->
## Run contract

- Mode: local folder. Claude Desktop and this folder must be available for the run.
- Cadence: the owner chooses and confirms the repeating time.
- Time zone: use the owner's confirmed local time zone; ask if it is missing.
- Maximum action level: B Draft. A run may observe or draft only.
- Approved sources: `business/`, `operations/`, `inbox/`, `reports/`, and only the connected sources named in this schedule.
- Freshness rule: show the source date or checked-at time for time-sensitive inputs. Treat undated or stale input as missing when it could change the result.
- Output: save drafts and summaries to `reports/` only. Never change `business/` or an outside system from a schedule.
- Missing input: stop the affected step, label the result incomplete, and list exactly what the owner needs to provide.
- Duplicate rule: never overwrite an existing report. Add the local run time or a sequence number to the filename.
- Failure path: write a short failure receipt to `reports/` when possible, then surface it at the next owner check-in. Never hide, retry a consequential action, or claim success without a saved result.
- Start every run by reading the full `CLAUDE.md`. End with a work receipt and a list of items that need the owner's decision.

## Prompt to copy

```text
Read the full CLAUDE.md before doing anything. If it is unavailable, stop.
This run is A Observe or B Draft only. Use approved sources, show checked-at times for changing input, and mark missing or stale input incomplete instead of guessing.
Save output to reports/ only. Never overwrite a file; add local time or a sequence number when needed. End with a work receipt and the owner's decision list.
Do not send, post, pay, file, sign, delete, or change an outside system.

Review the last seven days of operations/ and reports/, plus unresolved items in inbox/. Use business/ only as approved business truth.

Prepare a weekly operations review using templates/weekly-operations-review.md. Include source names and checked-at times for time-sensitive items. Separate facts, assumptions, recommendations, and proposed memory changes. Do not edit business/.

Save the result to reports/weekly-operations-review-[local date]-[local time or sequence].md. Never overwrite a file. End with a work receipt and a short list of the owner's decisions. Do not send, post, pay, file, sign, delete, or change anything outside this folder.
```

Action level: B - drafts only.
